# Your advice center for free software

Feeling lost in the huge and underground world of free software? Looking for alternatives to main software? Maybe want to collaborate and make a name for yourself in the development world? You have come to the right place.

In [this websites' name] you will be able to find the right solution for your needs. Whether it is a whole operating system or a specific app, tips and tricks and all that stuff, we got you covered.

## Homepage

In this section, you will find updates for what is going on in the free software world. From updates of the main GNU/Linux distros to tips and tricks to main free apps (not necessarily open source apps) and trending topics in related communities.

## GNU/Linux

This section features **main** GNU/Linux distros. Unlike some other places in the internet, we test the distro, talk to regular users and find how their experience has been, find the target user and review it in a *normal* language, so everyone can understand and so, make a choice.

## FOSS

Here we'll talk about ***Free, Open Source Software***. We distinguish apps and programs from the operating systems (hence why Linux is somewhere else). Here you can find state-of-the-art software that rivals their paid counterparts supported only by their communities (and some companies, of course). Who knows, maybe you find something unique for you...

## Free Software

To summarize, this is software that has *freemium* plans, meaning you have features for free, but to get to the more interesting stuff, you may want/have to pay. No, you will not find craking methods, keygens or all that stuff... That's pyracy (what's wrong with you!?).

## News

Here are the main news from all the sections above. Sources may include rss, social media and updates from official websites.

## Blog

Here are the users thoughts on some things. I know, lame; but you may want to read this or share your thoughts. You know, for the community.

This W.I.P. website is a project for Web and Mobile Development class @ EAN University in Bogot√°, Colombia.
